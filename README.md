# pothole-Image-processing


Aging roads and poor-road maintenance systems results a large number of Potholes which Jeopardise road safety, creates Traffic Congestion and serious harm to driver’s safety decreasing the transportation efficiency. To Prevent this, Our proposed approach can precisely detect potholes without false-positives and inexpensively over a wide area, and perform it with higher accuracy using OpenCV with deep learning. Therefore, the proposed real-time pothole detection approach can be used to improve the safety of traffic condition. We have established connectivity between Public Vehicles and our device which rectifies the range of defect precisely as it will use the mobility of the particular vehicle on which the system will be fitted, and side by side gather data from the vibrations and the GPS sensors, now using image processing techniques the process and filtering  of the data will be carried forward, and then information will be shared with the pothole repair corporation. Specific strategies can be developed using a Pothole Database, in Pothole-Detection System that collect’s the information and expand over a wide area.
